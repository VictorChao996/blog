# Internship Experience at iKala

I recently completed a QA internship at iKala. As a full-time software automation testing intern, I learned a great deal about the QA process, working in a small team, and the importance of quality assurance.

  

Below are some internship gains that I would like to share with you.

### 1. Gaining insights into the daily work of QAEs

- Observed the work of full-time QAEs, including test plan creation, test execution, and test report writing.
- Observe how QA full-time employees can propose appropriate establishment in meetings to improve the quality of the entire software development.
- Learned about efficient automated testing methods for growing software services, such as API testing.

### 2. Seeing the collaboration between a small-scale development teams

- Participated in product daily meetings, gaining insights into how development teams balance and address real-world challenges (e.g., encountered a product development team modifying the release process and timeline).
- Participated in sprint retro meetings, gaining a preliminary understanding of the work and content of non-development roles (e.g., PMs, CSMs, and salespeople).

### 3. Experiencing the satisfaction of solving real problems

- Working with full-time employees to **manually validate the product** in difference environment.
- **Researched and developed** the product's API E2E testing procedure.
- Created **documentation** for product automation testing **from scratch**.
- **Discussed and proposed** automation testing **development guidelines** with full-time employees. (ex. commit message specification)

### 4. Adapting to work environment

- As a full-time intern, although you do not need to bear the same responsibilities as a full-time employee, you still have pressure to adjust to.
- Experienced occasional frustration when efforts did not meet expectations.

### 5. Meet some interesting story

- Learned from career stories and advice shard by other employees
- Witnessed how the CEO of a company helped employees build confidence during TGIF events.

  

Overall, my internship at iKala was an incredibly rewarding experience that provided me with valuable insights into the QA process, the importance of teamwork, and the satisfaction of solving real-world problems. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a talented team of QAEs and developers, and I am confident that the skills and experience I gained at iKala will be invaluable in my future career.

**Although the internship was short, I learned so much, and the experience at iKala was more valuable than any class I took in school.** I am grateful for the support and guidance of my mentors, and I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I gained at iKala to my future endeavors.

  

In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentors and colleagues at iKala.

_Roger, thank you for being such a great partner. Your dedication, attention to detail. Your passion for QA is truly inspiring,_

_Rocky, thank you for sharing your career advice with me. Your insights have helped me to think more creatively about my future._

_Jason, thank you for your time and effort in training us interns. Your lessons on prioritization have been invaluable._

_To the other interns, it was a pleasure to get to know you, and I'm very happy to have a conversation with you._

I hope to see you all again soon.

最近剛結束在 iKala 的實習，作為一個全職的軟體自動化測試實習生我有幸能接觸許多不同的事物，下面與各位分享我這段實習的收穫。

### 1.了解 QAE 的工作日常

- 能觀察到 QAE 正職的工作，包括撰寫測試計劃、執行測試、撰寫測試報告等。
- 能了解到對於一個還在成長的軟體服務來說，何謂較有效率的自動化測試方法，如: 進行 API testing

### 2. 看到自有產品 + 中小型開發團隊的合作方式

- 參與到產品的 daily meeting，能夠從旁了解到開發團隊是如何權衡並著手解決現實世界的問題 (例: 剛好遇到產品開發團隊修改發布的流程 & 週期，為此要如何避免舊制&新制的衝突就是一大難題)
- 參與 sprint retro meeting ，能初步了解到開發以外的職位的工作事項與內容(例: PM、CSM、Sales 等)

### 3. 獲得解決實際問題時的成就感

- 與正職合作進行產品的手動驗證
- 研究並開發產品的 API E2E testing
- 從無到有建立產品自動化測試相關的文件
- 與正職建議並討論自動化測試開發的相關規範並 dry run (例: git commit 規範等)

### 4. 工作心態與環境的適應

- 做為一個全職實習生，雖然不需要像正值一樣承擔責任，但是仍然有壓力需要調適
- 當投入的努力不符合他人預期的目標時會比較失落

### 5. 聽到不少有趣的故事

- 聽聽前輩的職涯故事或建議
- 能見識到一家公司的執行長是如何在 TGIF 中幫助員工建立信心

  

簡短的說，我覺得在 iKala 真的是非常難得的經歷，他同時讓我一窺 QA 的日常、體會到團隊合作的重要，並且能讓我從解決現實問題中獲得滿足感。能有幸與其他 QAEs & 開發人員團隊合作，是我的榮幸，我相信我在 iKala 的經驗能對職涯發展有深刻的幫助。我也能借此經驗，重新思考我擅長並且能持續投入努力的領域。

  

最後，我要特別感謝在 iKala 共識的各位夥伴

_特別感謝 Roger: 感謝你跟我一起奮鬥，在成長的道路上可以找到能提問 & 互相幫助的人真的不容易，你對事物的認真與嚴謹很鼓勵我。(PS: 你有 QA 體質，非常適合當 QA )_

_特別感謝 Rocky: 感謝您不藏私的你我分享職涯的建議，讓我可以重新思考未來不同的可能性。_

_特別感謝 Jason: 感謝您花費自己的時間幫實習生們做 training，若以後有機會當 mentor，我會向您一樣與其他人分享知識。另外您也讓我明白做事一定要掌握 Priority，主要時間應該要花在目標上再去碰其他的東西會比較好。_

_感謝其他的實習生們，很高興能與你們對話，聽聽你們的故事，有緣能與你們共識真好。_

  

**我相信我們很快就有機會再見面的!**
